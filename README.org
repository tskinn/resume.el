* resume.el

org-mode -> HTML -> Print PDF

Adds a custom org-mode exporter that exports to stylized HTML. The HTML is meant to be easily printed as a PDF, resulting in a professional looking resume.

** Why
I dislike working with wysiwyg text editors. I've maintained a resume for many years in Latex and got sick of trying to reproduce a Latex environment every couple years to update my resume.

Upon looking into how to create custom exporters for Emacs' Org-mode, I threw this together with a dash of css and I was able to reproduce my previous resume in little time.

I've also added a little javascript to be able to experiment with font sizes without having to re-export.
